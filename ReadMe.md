## Design a solution to improve the focus of students and enhance attention span while studying.

## Description
DopeStudy is a website that enables students to maintain a disciplined schedule. We have built three features to help students in their academic journey.

## Features
- Pomodoro Timer: It consists of a 25 minute work session followed by 5 minutes of break.
- Puzzle game: Instead of mindlessly scrolling social media during breaks, students can engage themselves in puzzles and feel relaxed for the next work session.
- To do list: Many times students are not able to get work done because their priorities aren't set, this feature will help them always keep their goals in mind.

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Python
